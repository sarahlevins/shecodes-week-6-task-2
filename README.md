# Week 6 Task 2

Your task is to output a summary of whether item barcodes are valid or invalid given a shopping list and credit card number. This is building on from the algorithms we implemented last in week 2 of Python.

Some starter code is provided to help you get started.

Remember to test your code thoroughly against many different cases because we will try and break it ;)

Remember to use git to store your code!
